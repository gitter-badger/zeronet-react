# ZeroNet/React starter kit

This is an attempt to simplify ZeroNet website creation for react developer. So we can do more cool things !

Note: I am not a react developer. I am discovering the library while starting this project. Feel free to improve the react code.

## Start

Create zeronet website and save keys !

Need to add instructions to secure keys.

Start zeronet and access your address (keep it secret it will be your dev environnement).

## Add example project

Clone from github the example project

```
npm install
```

## Start gulp

We need to recreate the bundle.js file when one of our project file is modified.

```
gulp
```

# NOTES

## Router

Because in the url we have the adress of website we need to change the url base so it doesnt interfer with react-router.

Change the address in `app/router.js` for the one of your website.
